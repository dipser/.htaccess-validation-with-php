.htaccess-validation-with-php
=============================

Validate .htaccess-files with PHP.


<br />
### Idea behind it!

The *idea* behind this script is to allow changing the .htaccess over the website (e.g. CMS) without losing control over the server.
If you made typo or an error, the server is sending a "Internal server error" (500) and you cannot work over the website anymore! This script will *automatically* write the old content back, if you are producing an internal server error.

Do not lose control! :-)
